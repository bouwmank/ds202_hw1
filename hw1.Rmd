```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This homework is more or less a tutorial that helps you set up the coding environment used in this course, and familiarizes you with the format of the assignment submission. 
As a pre-requisite of this homework, first install R, and then the RStudio (the free version of Rstudio Desktop). 

1. Create a folder named `ds202_hw1`, and **either** create an RMarkDown file `hw1.Rmd` under this folder **or** move the provided template into this folder. `hw1.Rmd` will include your solutions. The file and folder names are *case-sensitive*, which means `hw1.Rmd` and `HW1.rmd` are different. *It is crucial to follow the exact folder structure and file names* in this course, so that your homework can be reproduced. The correct folder structure is

    ```
    ds202_hw1
    |-- hw1.Rmd
    |-- hw1.html (generated after knitting)
    ```
    
    Answer: Done

2. Write your name in the YAML of your homework `Rmd` file.

    Answer: Done

3. Write a paragraph to introduce yourself. Set your name in bold font and your major in italic. 

    Answer: Hello, I am **Kellan Bouwman** I am by credit a junior here at ISU. I am a *Data Science Major*, I am planing on taking a minor in something either business related or more technical. I am interneting this semester in a data research position. I plan to have statistics as my emphasis area. I have been working as a data analyst for the goverment for the last few years, so I have bit of exprience in making assessments and forecasting. I am looking for more of the math and techincal skills for the work force from this program. 
  
4. Write a paragraph describing a job that you think is related to data science. Include a hyperlink and an image. Make sure your answer is in a nice format to read. 

    Answer: For a data science job, I believe this field is incredably versitile and the amount of different jobs that you could have are endless. When trying to define something as a data science job first I look to see if it has data in the job descriptions. Then the amount and what they want to do with the data. So for example Amazon has a data scientist postion [AWS](https://amazon.jobmount.net/job-5e9e94a724543f2c335dd3f6-data-scientist-nationwide-opportunities-des-moines?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic), AWS being amazon web services. This position is focused on ML projects which uses alot of the data science techniques. ![AWS Logo](C:\ds202_hw1\aws-logo.png)
  
5. What data topic will you be most interested in? (Optional) Provide a source of such dataset if you have.

    Answer: Financial data is most of what I am intrested in, cost and profit analysts as well as efficiency data specficly.
  
6. To check that your R and Rstudio installation is correct, find the version of R by entering `version` into the R console. Include this command into a R code trunk in your solution `Rmd` file to have it automatically printed in the knitted html file. 

    Answer: R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22)
```{r}
`version`

```
    
    
7. Install git. 
    - If you are on Windows: 
        a. Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). In the coming weeks we will use the Git Bash (but not the Git GUI). 
        b. After installation, set up Rstudio to use Git bash as the shell for the Terminal: Open RStudio, click Tools--Global Options--Terminal; under **Shells**, select Git Bash; click OK. 
        c. In the main menu of RStudio: click Tools--Terminal--New Terminal. If you have a `$` before your prompt, then you should be good to go.
    - If you are on Linux or macOS, Git has probably been installed by default, so you do not need to install anything. Just click the Terminal tab (above the R Console).

    Answer: Done
  
8. What is the version of your Git? To find out, go to the Terminal tab in RStudio (right to the Console tab), and type in the following command. If it works, this shows that the setup of your terminal and Git is correct. 
<!-- Then explore the bash command line and Git. -->

    ```
    git --version
    ```

    Answer: git version 2.28.0.windows.1 
  
9. Configure your git username and user email by modifying and entering the following commands into the terminal

    ```
    git config --global user.name "your first and last name"
    git config --global user.email "yourEmail"
    ```

    Answer: Done
  

10. Register a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account. What is your username?

    Answer: bouwmank
